<div style="text-align: justify">Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? The spread of disease is a real concern for a world in which global travel is commonplace.
Aware of the serious situation, with this quick project I will build a mini dashboard to quickly update the global situation across the globe provided open data and using open source libraries.
https://towardsdatascience.com/@nik.piepenbreier We’ll be using data from this wonderful Github repository that auto-updates the data daily. We’ll load our data into a Pandas’ dataframe based on the URL so that it’ll update automatically for us every day.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.</div>
